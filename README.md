# Paint-Job-Estimator
This program uses the object-oriented approach to solve the problem, Paint Job Estimator. A painting company estimates a painting job based on these facts:
•	Total square feet to be painted and price for the paint per gallon
•	One gallon of paint covers 115 square feet of wall area
•	Painting one gallon of paint takes 8 hours of labor 
•	The company charges $18.00 per hour for labor

Display total square feet, number of gallons needed, hours of labor required, cost of paint, cost of labor and total cost of each room, and total cost of painting multiple rooms.
